# Hacktober Fest 2022 Flutter Open Source Project

This is an open source flutter project for begineers who want to contribute and explore the world of open source

How can you contribute to this project?

1. You can modify the currently available pages. Search for TODO's you will get to the pages that you can modify.
2. You can add new page widget in the `pages` folder with proper numbering and according to the page template and add a new page button in the `home_page.dart` and give proper values in the named parameters.

If you have any questions ask me anytime. I would love to answer any queries related to Flutter.
